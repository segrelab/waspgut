# Welcome to the Segr√® Lab Contributing Guide

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to our project! We love your input!

We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Proposing new features
- Contributing bug fixes, features, and new utilities

Please read our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/segrelab/.github/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community friendly and respectful.

## Asking questions

* Check this project's README to see if online documentation is available.
* If you need help and do not easily find an answer in the documentation, ask your question in a new issue. 
* Do not hesitate to open an issue. Any question you have likely indicates a shortcoming in the documentation, which we will also want to fix!


## Reporting a bug / proposing a feature

* **Check if the bug/feature request was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under Issues.

* If you cannot find an open issue addressing the problem, open a new one. Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible.

* If you are reporting a bug, it will be much easier to fix if you include a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Development Guidelines

We use GitHub to host code and documentation, track issues and feature requests, and accept pull requests.

### All Changes Happen Through Pull Requests

Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use the [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/) contribution models). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. [Fork the GitHub repository](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and create your branch from `develop`.
2. Add tests if you've added code that should be tested.
3. If you've added new features, update the documentation.
4. Ensure the test suite passes (_make sure you enable GitHub actions in your fork!_)
5. Make that pull request! Please ensure the pull request description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

### All contributions are under the MIT Software License
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

_No proprietary or copylefted code will be accepted!_

### **Do you want to add a new feature or change an existing one?**

We suggest you propose your change in a new issue and collect feedback before you start writing code or opening a pull request.
